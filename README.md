# Newsletter_SignUp
A simple project I made while learning about APIs to enable users to signup for newsletters.
I used nodejs, express with node, a little bit of frontend done by HTML, CSS and Bootstrap

Deployed the website on heroku.

P.S. Currently not functional as the Mailchimp API key was available for free only for a limited period of time
